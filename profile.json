This can be any part of the tree. The sapling will automatically be replaced, by using what the tree drops. There are many checks in the mod, from preventing accidental harvesting of houses made from logs to what leaves should decay.<br><br>By default the harvesting only works when holding the crouch button, but this can be toggled in the config. For more feature examples see below. There are lots of config options to tweak the mod exactly to your liking.</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Features with the default configuration settings:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>All trees, vanilla and modded, can be harvested quickly by crouching and chopping down one block.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>The time it takes to chop down a tree is determined by the amount of logs in it.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Leaves will decay very quickly after harvesting a tree.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Saplings will be replaced after the last leaf has been decayed.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Warped trees, in the nether, can be harvested quickly.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Huge mushrooms can also be harvested quickly<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Certain axe types can be exempted from harvesting trees via a blacklist.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Many checks to determine what is a tree and what isn't. No accidental destroying of houses.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>When two types of trees are next to each other, only the leaves of the tree broken will decay.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Compatible with other mods.<br></span><br><br><br><strong><span style=\"font-size:20px\">Configurable:</span> <span style=\"color:#008000;font-size:14px\"><a style=\"color:#008000\" href=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.information/wiki/how-to-configure-mods\" rel=\"nofollow\">(&nbsp;how do I configure?&nbsp;)</a></span><br></strong><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>mustHoldAxeForTreeHarvest</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, tree harvesting only works when a player is holding an axe in the main hand.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>treeHarvestWithoutSneak</strong>&nbsp;(default = false): If enabled, tree harvesting works when not holding the sneak button. If disabled it's reversed, and only works when sneaking.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>automaticallyFindBottomBlock</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): Whether the mod should attempt to find the actual bottom log of the tree and start there. This means you can break a tree in the middle and it will still completely be felled.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>enableFastLeafDecay</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, the leaves around a broken tree will quickly disappear.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>enableNetherTrees</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, the warped stem/crimson trees in the nether will also be chopped down quickly.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>enableHugeMushrooms</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, giant/huge mushrooms will also be chopped down quickly.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>ignorePlayerMadeTrees</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, trees with leaves placed by players won't be destroyed.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>replaceSaplingOnTreeHarvest</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, automatically replaces the sapling from the drops when a tree is harvested.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>replaceMushroomOnMushroomHarvest</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, automatically replaces the sapling from the drops when a huge mushroom is harvested and 'enableHugeMushrooms' is enabled.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>loseDurabilityPerHarvestedLog</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, for every log harvested, the axe held loses durability.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>loseDurabilityModifier</strong>&nbsp;(default = 1.0, min 0.001, max 1.0): Here you can set how much durability chopping down a tree should take from the axe. For example if set to 0.1, this means that every 10 logs take 1 durability.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>increaseExhaustionPerHarvestedLog</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, players' exhaustion level increases 0.005 per harvested log (Minecraft's default per broken block) * increaseExhaustionModifier.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>increaseExhaustionModifier</strong>&nbsp;(default = 1.0, min 0.001, max 1.0): This determines how much exhaustion should be added to the player per harvested log. By default 0.005 * 1.0.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>increaseHarvestingTimePerLog</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, harvesting time will increase per existing log in the tree. The amount is determined by 'increasedHarvestingTimePerLogModifier'.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>increasedHarvestingTimePerLogModifier</strong>&nbsp;(default = 0.1, min 0.01, max 10.0): How much longer it takes to harvest a tree with 'increaseHarvestingTimePerLog' enabled. The actual speed is: newSpeed = originalSpeed / (1 + (logCount * increasedHarvestingTimePerLogModifier)).</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>amountOfLeavesBrokenPerTick</strong>&nbsp;(default = 3, min 1, max 16): How many leaves should be broken per tick after a tree has been harvested. Increasing this will speed up the fast leaf decay, but costs more processing power per tick.</span><br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Axe Blacklist Feature:</strong></span><br>It's possible to only allow certain axes to harvest trees. On first load of the mod a blacklist file is generated. It is located at <strong><em>./config/treeharvester/harvestable_axe_blacklist.txt</em></strong>. This works for modded axe items as well.<br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/tree-harvester/blacklist.jpg\"><br><br><br><span style=\"font-size:36px\"><strong>Some GIFs:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Harvesting a birch tree next to another oak.

These bounties often ask for you to bring back an item, or kill some mobs in return for whatever rewards they're offering. If you can complete the bounty, you just have to bring it back to the bounty board and right click the board to redeem your rewards!\n\n\n### Decrees\n\nThere exists another item as well, called a Decree. A Decree determines what kind of bounties show up on a bounty board. For example, an Armorsmith's Decree makes it so that objectives and rewards related to armor show up on the board (leather, iron, chestplates, boots, etc). You can have up to three decrees on a bounty board at once, and it will mix and match objectives and rewards from all three when new bounties appear!\n\nYou can find new Decrees as rewards for certain bounties, or make your own. Crafting your own will create a random decree when you place it onto the board.\n\n### Bounty Tiers\n\nJust like items, bounties can have different tiers of rarity. Some bounty rewards are more rare than others, and bounties with higher rarity have a better chance of having these more rare rewards! Rarity follows the same pattern as in vanilla: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Epic.\n\n### Reputation\n\nAll bounty boards have their own value associated with them called \"Reputation\". As you turn in more bounties, this number goes up! The higher the reputation, the more often rare bounties show up on the bounty board. Some bounty rewards may not even show up until you reach high enough reputations.\n\n### Compat\n\nCurrently, I've added some support for some items from different Fabric mods. Feel free to suggest compat with other Fabric mods (but I may be stingy! For example: I'm not likely to add compat with items that involve a lot of time to craft, since it may break progression for some modpacks).\n\n \n\nI plan on adding more in the future!\n\n### Why?\n\nI originally made this mod so that I could be given some goals to accomplish, which would stave off boredom. It gives players something to do when they're bored, and a fun way to incentivize crafting items they'd otherwise maybe not be making!\n\n### Help\n\nUntil the wiki is complete, you can get help on [my Discord server.](https://discord.gg/TCsRjJ6vwZ)\n\n#### Credits:\n\nAkiShirai, for the wonderful bounty board block art.","published":"2021-08-29T02:15:45.939419Z","updated":"2024-03-04T06:47:13.142048Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":399726,"followers":414,"categories":["adventure","economy","utility"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18-pre5","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["b745WfGi","FW2gMFWm","s7W0BcY3","yII7Bu5c","vMLc67VP","hYrrBKBT","qFqfFMMO","j44RssVC","RJHSMTU7","b9dZ8adN","2KAmOHQt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BpwWFOVM/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"j44RssVC","project_id":"BpwWFOVM","author_id":"HpLaZ9DK","featured":false,"name":"Bountiful 6.0.3+1.20.1-Forge","version_number":"6.0.3+1.20.1","changelog":"### Added\n- Implemented the new item group system, so that items will once again show up in creative tabs, as well as in JEI.\n- Added processor lists, so that bounty boards can generate with a different look depending which village it generates in.\n- Added Numismatic Overhaul compat for Fabric.\n- Updated translations.\n- Added a default single localization override for Decrees\n### Fixed\n- Fixed the \"missing ops\" cosmetic issue upon world load.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-17T23:20:12.066311Z","downloads":95759,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"02eb2051f9e255993e433a0cef1b78a36569241bf6fa966dc2ea4db3474ea213e2f64f69606b53b00221cb4d136a866bf4069d6a7ad969a2c31dfe7a0909db28","sha1":"ec42b8789b43bb71787c350a55e8e879d645c797"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BpwWFOVM/versions/j44RssVC/Bountiful-6.0.3%2B1.20.1-forge.jar","filename":"Bountiful-6.0.3+1.20.1-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":504978,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"E0GS19K7","project_id":"zfbCkvdZ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"JoLgnJ0G","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"p2GXgSkh","project_id":"ordsPcFz","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"qvvDCp9U","user":{"id":"HpLaZ9DK","username":"ejektaflex","name":"Ejektaflex","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23628421?v=4","bio":"I write code!

This will explain the absence of updates. Why again? It's just not fun anymore and I am always worried about once again being embedded in annoying discord drama that somehow manages to suck every bit of enjoyment out of modding. There hasn't been anyone willing to step up and take over development and that's partly my fault. This notice is months late. If you enjoy fastload and intend to maintain it, just contact me on discord for a discussion. Please keep in mind that I won't respond quickly because I don't really use discord much at all anymore. Thank you for taking your time to read this!\n\n# Short explanation\nFastload is a *relatively* simple mod that changes some crucial parts of world loading to speed it up.\n\n# Environments\n- Client (Optional)\n- Server (Optional)\n\n# Credits\n- StockiesLad (Owner)\n- JoostMSoftware (Co-Owner)\n- AbdElAziz333 (Forge)\n- VidTu (Ksyxis (Idea))\n- kennytv (Forcecloseloadingscreen (Code))\n\n# Features\n- 441 Pre-generator: Entirely yanks it to sync chunk generation with chunk rendering.\n- Loading Screens: Cancellable (Configurable)\n- Rendering: Pre-rendering Phase (Configurable)\n\n# Suggested With\n- C2ME: Optimises chunk generation.\n- Sodium: Optimises chunk rendering.\n\n# Explanation\nThe 441 chunk loading engine is pretty much what the name is. The reason for it being 441 chunks is that\nit generates chunks in a 10 chunk radius as a square. So multiply that by 2, add 1 (because you are standing\non a chunk) and square it. Fastload removes this *feature* as it is a huge waste of time. Instead, it will\nonly load 1 chunk (the spawn chunk) and loads the rest of the spawn region during early rendering.\n\nAlong with that, it also replaces some of the loading screens with its own implementation. This pretty much\nallows rendering to begin immediately instead of it being halted until the player spawn packet is received.\n\n# Links\n- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload\n- Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastload\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/fMSnenNSXM\n\n","published":"2022-06-04T16:09:02.891982Z","updated":"2023-08-15T12:36:53.077035Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1428950,"followers":1275,"categories":["optimization","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["OAv8CrM0","hR5aj90D","Lbph3YVy","nkXCDjTX","CVP8s8T3","tFMofdbs","3j5R1tqr","opd0zx0e","iiKA1DWl","DVbkQeRT","bAEd4DsW","PjaIK1Vp","tAJHf9G7","wIStpaL0","8J8D4v6o","1wIMDix7","BnPn5A62","f4sYhmcE","meWCSzii","DJkYeZd5","1f1DA0KB","QNff3l3l","QlIwIIh9","C2LwOzJk","1uyZI4Sv","FKmzXNtY","K88McHch","DQlQxhhM","qIDVvUbg","nAfxWveV","MmygcB2M","zNe7bwry","Tv3wOvtj","ksl46t40","qkR1zzal","dKaZj3NX","bxgfNPxE","LtO049ip","RWontocM","tMBTPH4j","rGmamzE5","gdXi90uO","Dsgo7CSj","2Yda0wxa","pPHZxvSq","mBNst1pT","NHYFVTEV","WyunD6Js","N1SrNeBH","IpZXHH55","rxKwFSer","ZlGXwJvh","TQqs51tn","DadZpSjE","tMPV3Kkg","ZF0uERgW","FpDn2R2L","gIRDVsr1","a5IjqNvz","DlCLRU3a","WU1it2AO","FU50wLzH","DhZ4Ja4S","Y0vyVBp6","suyTpHDo","gO58JOqR","K9vr5fdy","OQyAqgWH","AWGFfzNY","Jy0nBwT7","n2GBDiY8","YvKzIdFE","lbg7lLOP","XzqjhWvy","GCH0zDV1","cOIVKLwU","FswsA1ru","pDTCLzgm","s3zsS0HW","tykaPrWr","ILYiaB6n","jbjSMJqM","JpRTQ4PR","vD6ndABa","WryJ0FUZ","FcFh2FAO","PB8AbQO3","BwDnLgzN","OxwM6hRt","u4FVRRGd","ys9T20o4","47qpvpOP","P17HkM27","9Kgnmrza","3cboK7gk","HDvAnQIw","Z8CqLDDO","nHeyxX0A","fbLmfqa5","ka9OYmub","5caSj7kt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/47742fe96d19cdad9a3eb6a73bd9c7c1547fb4ad.png"},"version":{"id":"5caSj7kt","project_id":"kCpssoSb","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Fastload 3.4.0 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"mc1.20.1-3.4.0","changelog":"bump version.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-15T12:36:55.631401Z","downloads":194256,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"b8be6ed0bef707c7c34d84049eb68313a5c787f6e9c9a88fb94daed6bccfedc6c181a1fca431f53b6e8ac03c7baf7653414b5a5792cab6b500c6d66502489431","sha1":"27d58f123951e0404c94caf16ff9b96b442f371c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/versions/5caSj7kt/Fastload-Reforged-mc1.20.1-3.4.0.jar","filename":"Fastload-Reforged-mc1.20.1-3.4.0.jar","primary":true,"size":66989,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"GIn4UWLW","username":"KirboSoftware","name":"Joost","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80041873?v=4","bio":"I'm a junior software engineer who creates minecraft mods in my spare time and help with projects when I can","created":"2022-06-04T15:56:54.106893Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Co-owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"6RqzXTwc","username":"StockiesLad","name":"Fluffy Bumblebee","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60066663?v=4","bio":"A lad from stockies mate.","created":"2022-06-04T16:04:13.709905Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Fastload-Reforged-mc1.20.1-3.4.0.jar"},"mods\\jei-1.20.1-forge-15.3.0.4.jar":{"sha512":"ed6e240182aac592963b1f0bf0252f5f17dded33da6201e8a2eba460a7e25ec8c2d68e9798f858a19e63879867530c77903e491b537ba25d8e0e138b540f50e4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"u6dRKJwZ","slug":"jei","project_type":"mod","team":"H2zAm1Kt","title":"Just Enough Items","description":"JEI -

This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not.

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-05-25T20:34:39.856745Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":6371675,"followers":4992,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon","bketoxVs","frGGaFrx","gO8hxcyv","ugIRhLoi","2LyjkgAv","PG8gMKcT","4Nq7hEtl","hyejM5za","SzEdoick","UHcskdEO","92bPVm5F"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"17Hi340V","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.2-1.20.2 - Forge","version_number":"1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Update to 1.20.2\r\n* Create fr_fr.json by @Calvineries in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* Create vi_vn.json by @ImVietnam in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Calvineries made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* @ImVietnam made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.2-1.20...1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-22T17:07:52.006115Z","downloads":712613,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"a184f3a963c07f7026fb6d8ccd83ca29e7f7b009","sha512":"14f6b9b3161d6ebeaefaa1efc08b72a98d82aacf6f9956c3a5bff9daaae3d0200cfdb2034c2321849acf0aafaf0450cbd075a92138e1500f31a70666c59e258f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/17Hi340V/entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":62127,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"poie5Iwy","username":"vicisacat","name":"vicisacat","avatar_url":null,"bio":"I made the Entity Culling port for beta 1.7.3 and that's it.

Energistics 2","description":"AE2: A popular automation and storage mod","body":"Applied Energistics 2 (AE2) is a comprehensive mod for Minecraft that introduces a unique approach to in-game inventory management. It presents a tech-based, futuristic theme, centered around the concept of using energy and technology to convert matter into energy and vice versa. Please come visit our [homepage](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne).\n\n![image of subnetworks from the guidebook](https://guide-assets.appliedenergistics.org/minecraft-1.20.1/ae2/ae2-mechanics/subnetworks_scene1.njRxulYCJ84v.png)\n\nKey features of the mod include:\n\n**Storage Systems**: AE2 revolutionizes storage in Minecraft. The mod adds a network-based digital storage system, where items and blocks are stored as energy in a digital form within a network of connected devices. This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items.\n\n**Auto-Crafting**: Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort.\n\n**Networking and Channels**: AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system. Devices connected to the same network can communicate and interact with each other, and the channel system limits the number of devices that can be connected to a single cable, adding a layer of planning and organization to your builds.\n\n**Spatial Storage**: This feature allows players to store entire regions of space within a spatial storage cell. Essentially, you can take a chunk of the world, including all blocks, items, and entities within, and store it digitally to be released later.\n\n**Unique Resources**: AE2 introduces several new resources and materials for crafting its technological components, such as Certus Quartz, Fluix Crystals, and Inscribers. Many of these new materials come with their own decorative blocks to spice up your builds.\n\nAE2 is known for the complexity and depth it adds to Minecraft's tech gameplay, encouraging players to create, optimize, and manage large-scale, efficient systems. It is a fantastic mod for those who love to automate processes and manage resources efficiently.","published":"2021-12-14T11:50:43.324146Z","updated":"2024-05-28T21:17:23.133302Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":506844,"followers":529,"categories":["storage","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["OqkivEmV","DZZbZnbH","cLm6eoS7","Bf4qfsQf","6AN4WLgf","n6ctl28A","ePPHPjw7","EkIUZgzp","uWZo3axN","kOb7LSAK","pRtKJO4l","2TIYWbvo","aUAC5DXB","mlkfFOT9","Q6LSGEqw","f0cVzJbq","xKkeaqkM","2OY506tW","LmtoNQhm","Ieppgyii","XSv7aCzj","7rSpITeE","Z32dIodF","fMM2pwnM","Woty8glY","NFcpTG3k","W5IItIBw","xDGpy4Qn","ByV6cOMZ","nZG3f7mn","697yLiPU","fjroW9SS","BF8g0TZ3","sWmGENVC","qosXJAjq","OiY2lfg0","3FuIT2JI","5KhL4WhW","RWto5Lhw","wHN8x90L","sm5CvPw0","oMLKu1Ze","nuYdiTZB","oLeqpmhw","mV6fTxoi","kOcIph1U","HJrR1zgA","JSwFZQ02","aR5tGCcS","s3g4KtWI","enxs5scj","9WXP1AHX","mv6YbdV3","7Gq3qbtw","bD9ZXRfC","7UmbOb4g","WVYkyvRH","bpkm2yMw","C5nwXELu","ZaNpnMCh","OFBWYrp4","PvPdRUHX","PDkmB4UV","zkC0WSUn","Z6jnGDF9","5xa1OSzf","5EyIPVWA","XVFb5sJ7","WzDBx3u7","YNFx3Hjn","nrq8eC4Q","6VmOchNB","9XtLETKp","hCIvVRgg","RFmdcgz3","vrdekdmw","Z8OKgUoh","P4SHVMac","25KjhlGv","S3K8G49B","6qQEQmM8","36EMfB3q","DZd4yQe4","c3zEVaQ8","wYymrhE4","8HeKobcP","yz68xU3j","pcHc3tZs","MrXpPIvo","aszqg0Wn","WAh5HPC8","RgkwNSjT","62yssi1E","A5FUIGjh","q5TQ3zgd","9P35YnKN","ix3GcoBP","RJnK9Ovj","MoGLgJK1","t3aUE6HS","7NWAte1m","PWdOzVug","HQd68kb6","lp2vAcHP","c0KKkf1Z","zhr2jXaL","9evKVcVd","MPdVG6oo","COSdQAoF","TBVf9h2p","CKA0xF7f","GL3uhBGD","brl6VeNy","TMEAMYIx","g7uJnOOS","sALiGsl3","yIupDKor","oAGWsu3M","JRLfd73N","UAuf0uiD","3Mvq6QHo","L6VGYHd3","y5W8KGqT","xGjt6qMm","sOqmy2ww","COba8tGt","8C4WbuoI","NX3fAZif","DsTIvcA1","Tw8kyhfI","NHcKcc8c","Xc1WEGPd","1HKx8M9v","qf2Yz73T","8HEK7sk8","ijZQY1Rd","xzP4cydc","a5pC6xdL","QalOLGBM","RpMpf7zi","Zrp3c9yN","7vB6vk2v","7ACUdipn","Sz6f1zJd","qfpQmwll","lePuKDdy","TKhjxSIB","oS3Ga2mY","7j0MvcB1","IcREcVDb","Mdn0ka1O","AxEi5RIz","b13bPfeM","rLjoLUTF","wGIGpPsQ","tifFqBKk","W4efZESl","lThI0ayT","qBbqV301","l3tOwBzj","LxjXwNSj","Bj8oQseU","IWm9cQdw","CkK2zzkf","xUoHYNEg","5cb16tgY","HAKkYcmv","1kT0YXJf","BUHQD4RJ","lT1sdBmI","fwLnPXom","8edEAu2V","aQH6ftSR","U3MExcIx","OIOSSXhK","Cf5vGMwV","XfVOZDN8","jgICE67P","nhQTb3m4","ZVjAvWE5","MNGBfmiy","b1U0ez1e","fFh1IdTY","fugqOJWC","LznTi8p2","dhrGFcqh","VI3B0aKr","ibJ4Ydxw","ZBr63LNs","qGKR0YVC","d1AtkO1b","3ZI8DotD","YO5wVxT7","XCXfEG6G","hNV0u2Ke","GkAgfE4B","u5dC9pjL","ZZZyMiY4","NmC7F1OZ","i1h1wOhr","3fQeIJU2","Hnumk0Bl","RQKXi0Jk","ZyC52h3W","SK6yn8MM","w2R8hIML","WJVipmUL","pThfoWlc","D7bfN7hf","QV62CH9w","BZL7JFgj","uAI0bShS","kP2VZhqZ","4I61MxJa","pHuguX3Y","hYG5tbva","FNy8w4ic","UmQtYI0G","792UNplB","Euz9WnGy","JWh6WyXU","FzURHfti","RpmE1nzj","UvErlgaY","xn5sieSc","Lo9sz0BU","pUCfuoqf","EtNeQMla","OK01nNQM","WIIZmqs6","kywcQ25B","isHbiIeZ","pGnl32B8","tjB3sQ3W","NoFBkXQe","9Vscdpuz","CEmkqbKV","qpG9cRjY","fZYI0nmw","mfB8KDaB","L3u3Zbmr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XxWD5pD3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"xUoHYNEg","project_id":"XxWD5pD3","author_id":"3HAu37Rl","featured":false,"name":"AE2

to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

Config Lib","description":"Config Lib makes dealing with config files just a bit easier.","body":"![SuperMartijn642's Config Lib](https://imgur.com/oVcLlAO.png)   \n**SuperMartijn642's Config Lib** allows you to **specify a config once** and it then **handles reloading values between world loads, syncing values with clients**, and **generating values for client- or server-only** on its own.\n\n---\n\n### Creating a config:\nA config is created using a `ModConfigBuilder`.\nSimply create a new instance using `#ModConfigBuilder()`.\n```java\n   ModConfigBuilder builder = new ModConfigBuilder();\n```\nA value can be added to the config with `ModConfigBuilder#define` which takes a name and a default value.\nFor integer and double values a minimum and maximum value are also required.\n`ModConfigBuilder#define` returns a `Supplier` which should be stored to retrieve the value from the config.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> booleanValue = builder.define( \"booleanValue\", true );\n\n   Supplier<Integer> integerValue = builder.define( \"integerValue\", 5, 0, 10 );\n\n   Supplier<Double> doubleValue = builder.define( \"doubleValue\", 0.5, 0, 1);\n\n   Supplier<ExampleEnum> enumValue = builder.define( \"enumValue\", ExampleEnum.VALUE_1 );\n```\nA comment can be added to a value by calling `ModConfigBuilder#comment(String)` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> valueWithComment = builder.comment( \"this is a comment for 'valueWithComment'\" ).define( \"valueWithComment \", true );\n```\nBy default values are reloaded when world is loaded.\nThis can be changed to only reload a value when Minecraft launches by calling `ModConfigBuilder#gameRestart()` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notReloadedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be reloaded\" ).define( \"notReloadedValue\", true );\n```\nValues in COMMON or SERVER configs are synchronized with clients by default, to prevent this use `ModConfigBuilder#dontSync()`.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notSynchronizedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be synchronized\" ).define( \"notSynchronizedValue\", true );\n```\nValues can also be put into categories.\n`ModConfigBuilder#push(String)` pushes a category and `ModConfigBuilder#pop()` pops a category.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"special\" );\n   \n   Supplier<Boolean> specialValue = builder.comment( \"this value is in the 'special' category\" ).define( \"specialValue\", true );\n   \n   builder.pop();\n```\nA comment can be added to the active category using `ModConfigBuilder#categoryComment(String)`.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"client\" ).categoryComment( \"this, is a comment for the 'client' category\" );\n```\nAfter defining all values `ModConfigBuilder#build()` must be called to finish the config.\n```java\n   builder.build();\n```\nNow the values in your config will reloaded and synced automatically and the values can be retrieved using the stored `Supplier` instances.\nThis will work for all available versions, that includes Minecraft 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mod:\nFor a

You can use [Scarecrows' Territory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/scarecrows-territory/files) if you want mob spawning.  \n**Can I use your mod in my modpack?**  \nYes, feel free to use

It is not affiliated with me and causes critical untrackable bugs/crashes.\n\n<p>Unlike many other minimap mods, Xaero's minimap keeps the <strong>aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft</strong>, which helps it be a more seamless addition to the game. It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided.

Can be useful when playing with other UI mods.</li>\n<li>2 block color modes:&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Vanilla</strong>, which uses the colors of vanilla Minecraft maps and&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Accurate</strong>, which uses the colors of block textures and biomes. You can also enable biome colors for the Vanilla mode using a separate setting.</li>\n<li>A custom key binding (Z by default) to temporarily enlarge the minimap to take a better look around.&nbsp;<strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.&nbsp;</strong>There are also settings for controlling the behavior of the minimap when it is enlarged, for example to center the minimap on the screen or to fully zoom out the minimap.</li>\n<li>Map shading customization with the \"Terrain Depth\" and \"Terrain Slopes\" settings.</li>\n<li>Compatible with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's World Map</a>. By default uses the map textures generated by the world map mod instead of generating its own. This improves performance when using both mods.</li>\n<li>Option to limit your minimap access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets. Your current set can be quickly switched with a key binding. <strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sharing</strong>. You can share your waypoints in the game chat with players on the server. This is done from the waypoints list (press U).</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Deathpoints</strong>. An&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">automatic skull-shaped waypoint</strong>&nbsp;is created&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">on each death</strong>.

The chunks where slimes can spawn are marked with a green overlay.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom light overlay</strong>. You can setup a light overlay that will mark blocks with a custom color if they are within a custom light value range, which is block light from 0 to 7 by default. The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\". You can do it through the <em>Waypoints Menu (press U) -&gt; Options</em> screen.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mobs</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">yellow dots.</strong>&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Hostile and friendly</strong>&nbsp;mobs can be colored&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">differently. </strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">players</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">white dots or player heads.&nbsp;</strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">items</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">red dots. </strong>Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays all the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">other entities</strong>&nbsp;such as arrows and item frames as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">purple dots</strong><span class=\"bbc\">.</span><strong class=\"bbc\">&nbsp;</strong>Different types of entities can be disabled in the settings.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Options for <strong>displaying entity names </strong>on the minimap<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in the \"Entity Radar\" settings.</li>\n<li>Zoom in and out key bindings&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">(I and O by default) </strong>to efficiently change the zoom level to fit your preference or use case.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Coordinates&nbsp;</strong>under the minimap.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Current biome name</strong>&nbsp;under the minimap.

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode and/or entity radar on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;n&sect;o&sect;m&sect;i&sect;n&sect;i&sect;m&sect;a&sect;p</strong> - disables the minimap completely</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

The profession of the villager is also visible on the trade screen. You can also use your own custom name lists, see below.

with some mods falsely flagging the mod as a \"Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B!ml\".<br />This is a false positive. Microsoft has fixed this in their latest Defender update. The solution is to update Windows Defender's definitions.<br /><br />This can be done via Windows Update, or alternatively via these steps:<br />1. Open command prompt as administrator.<br />2. Run the following, without the “-quotes: <br /><br />“cd C:\\Program Files\\Windows Defender && MpCmdRun.exe -removedefinitions -dynamicsignatures && MpCmdRun.exe -SignatureUpdate”<br /><br />That's it! I wish I could do more. I can assure you there is nothing wrong with the mod. Hopefully in a few days Defender be updated automatically for everyone.</p><p>The complete changelog with previous versions can be found at: <br>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://serilum.com/mods?changelog=collective\" target=\"_blank\">https://serilum.com/mods?changelog=collective</a></p>","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-12T18:20:36.432071Z","downloads":203559,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d98a5bce4189afe227a4aec091b9cebd2e33ddf21c9322b1f4af1370fa578383e7d6561e7e89ee5f741c6dbf348c7c1b74172291ef4e4cc534cb4817c91d8c2c","sha1":"19e0c11ee46e360daf5e9b2f3c8ea11a046e3b73"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/e0M1UDsY/versions/wipAhCa0/collective-1.20.1-7.40.jar","filename":"collective-1.20.1-7.40.jar","primary":true,"size":589600,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"UTtoE2WS","user":{"id":"NIbuUGD2","username":"Serilum","name":"Rick South","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/NIbuUGD2/icon.png","bio":"🇳🇱 Makes Minecraft mods and a few other random bits of software.

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-05-01T06:08:18.836384Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":5461567,"followers":5113,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"DG5Fn9Sz","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Forge)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:40:26.306516Z","downloads":435403,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"417fb6ce8f52abf40bd9d0390371790f9576f8ba","sha512":"a1960a7c03dc32d4ccaccaf28afdd9b078758bbd62d15a91d4039a83fa9397a098e89b69591f6bd5190254d9ee97e502504154b9aec764adb8c65f000b75ba2c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/DG5Fn9Sz/ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":123034,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar"},"mods\\polymorph-forge-0.49.2+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"b98103f539b000b1e4e866ff3276aeddfcb1e3198ebe8f0e5d88f24b96cb3f65a335016e8bc03bd41f78b3f6fc6a7f06973dff3bd3e7739f222ad56cde05b9d4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"tagwiZkJ","slug":"polymorph","project_type":"mod","team":"IyMJnv3l","title":"Polymorph","description":"No more recipe conflicts!

Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the\ncrafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients\ndon't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection.\n\n### Smelting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QX9MNYM/polymorph-furnacedemo.gif)\n\nWhen a valid input matches more than one output, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing\nthis button will show a list of all possible results with the currently selected result highlighted\nin green. Selecting one of the listed results will change the smelting output to match. This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder. Currently, the command will scan crafting,\nsmelting, blasting, smoking, and smithing recipes.\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n","published":"2023-02-03T20:08:37.444573Z","updated":"2024-05-29T10:25:57.202739Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":902152,"followers":396,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["diy4s2XO","66Bkdq05","68l9BR3j","bT9w3gh5","hR8YtS8a","gxwQtnsA","vAv92Cl4","vuRsKlbz","cnPRpn78","tLFw14o5","haoNzeyv","750iJ3hO","rect6WEh","aYxyXMzJ","ChHxCoAb","STYYlkp8","wN8G3kAN","skUakdXR","uAleZkbS","SNlci35k","GKZ6KVfs","6Nyu412V","VQtXcHcR","bIDSNOm5","UlRasi89","l15iQHMn","AWwJD7yS","7L5hC81R","zncS6GGa","pJZr4yc3","8zhVFKEL","Sj0OPjRM","2BAp032A","FBfg7una","E4b6m0sQ","GcFD377O","km82tZAr","gXWxJGsW","Y8yR5ZhZ","qA4syOxx","akZJjqpV","iaqnjwBU","6tFcWl5d","Mq4la1Hv","W3ii0PIQ","N1NUMRCn","89IAarqG","ByjYK8ay","EYWxtHOI","V6TZ8mE6","OQP0nLJU","R9HsHDwY","GTEspIbt","wZ1N91Ci","yPIvYQkJ","QoURX3fY","3RJxqsNz","p4JIL4TF","3XAwKo9y"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/ed244c5829bde539763c7fffb55cb3194a349d66.png"},"version":{"id":"km82tZAr","project_id":"tagwiZkJ","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"polymorph-forge-0.49.2+1.20.1","version_number":"0.49.2+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

This mod adds a hand full of peripherals that allow futher access to Creates features.\n\n## Content\n> 👉 _**Create** now actually has native support for **CC: Tweaked** too! But why stop there?_\n\n- **Two essential blocks of this mod are the `Source Block` and `Target Block`.**\nThey simulate a source or target, making it possible to comunicate within every other source/target that **Create** provides.\n\n- Another block that can come in very handy is the `RedRouter Block`.\nIt can send or receive redstone signals without having to worry about wireless channels or by using multible Computers, using the Redstone API.\n\n- This mod also adds some smaller, fun things like the `Scroller Pane` or `Animatronic`. The Scroller Pane lets you select a number and send it to a Computer using **Creates** interface, while the Animatronic is a puppet you can [control and animate as you like!](https://youtu.be/MI_tHMHrAY0)\n\n### Psst, hey! Why don't you check out the gallery as well?\n\n## Tutorials\n_But how do I use the peripherals?_ Good question! We are constantly updating **our [wiki section](https://cccbridge.tweaked-programs.cc/)**, in order to make it easy for you developers to keep up with all the changes! **We now switched to our own domain for this!**\n\n> 👉 _Just like **CC: Tweaked**, we try to keep backwards compatibility as much as possible! Because of **Creates** nature of updating things, we can't guarantee this however._\n\n---\n\n# Happy coding and producing!\n","published":"2022-08-04T21:38:14.402877Z","updated":"2023-11-13T16:44:57.559200Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":70364,"followers":134,"categories":["technology","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["6gFSB2cb","SHtSVyPj","4FAugHCK","RmMbmMxs","TSlKJnFI","Pu6WWjXy","F6VLKITg","kqa9TcGO","nefRvVSC","GfPgRnaJ","Lak8yNkA","mEqr6s4n","hcUse6zC","JWA3Ln0O","VUgVNrXb","bm4MC9fD","GJHezNYH","7ZMkp8vc","wCHQIZkL","ajroWplh","ZQr9o4rM","48CSf0v7","3iyZZsnj","kriL4Yqq","wJFFxsk3","S5lsxWv6","57pJUQQM","sPKVzUaW"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fXt291FO/0a7670a36212340465e689bbd107e921a45065ad.webp"},"version":{"id":"sPKVzUaW","project_id":"fXt291FO","author_id":"wq0m29UH","featured":false,"name":"CC:C Bridge 1.6.3-forge","version_number":"1.6.3-forge","changelog":"**_Forge port after later ™️_**\n- Applied base code from Fabric _(see [changelog](https://modrinth.com/mod/cccbridge/changelog?l=fabric&g=1.20.1) of 1.6.X from fabric)_\n- Fixed missing translations for paintings\n- Fixed typos in German translation\n- Updated CC:T to 1.108.4\n- Updated Create to 0.5.1.d-9\n\n_Note: CC:C Config screen is not accessible.

This is required for mod configuration, as it allows for using the exact same system as on the Forge mod loader.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

Slicer\n\nThis mod enables a variety of features to create better compatibility between mostly [Farmer's Delight][FARMERS_DELIGHT_FORGE] and [Create][CREATE_FORGE].\nWhile it is designed to work with Farmer's Delight, it does work without it and also adds some compatibility features for other mods.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/slicer.png)\n\n### Automatic Cutting\n\nThe Main feature of the mod is the _Slicer_, a machine similar to the _Mechanical Mixer_ or _Mechanical Press_ from Create.\nIt automatically registers all cutting recipes from Farmer's Delight. In that sense, it is an automatic _Cutting Board_.  \nIn order to use it, the correct tool has to be placed into the machine, using `Right-Click`.\nBy default, only knives and axes are allowed, but this behaviour can be overwritten by modifying the `sliceanddice:allowed_tools` item tag.\nAn example datapack which adds shears to this tag can be found [here](https://github.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/raw/1.20.x/example_datapack.zip)\n\n### Automatic Cooking\n\nAll recipes from Farmer's delight requiring the Cooking Pot are added as heated mixing recipes.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/cooking.png)\n\n### Sprinkler\n\nThe Sprinkler is a block which, when provided with a fluid using a pipe, will distribute it in a small area below.  \nDifferent fluids can have different effects.\n\n- Lava applies a small amount of fire damage to entities below\n- Water makes the area below wet, making the world think it's raining there.\n- Potions apply their affect for a short duration to entities below\n- Liquid Fertilizer, a new fluid, applies a bonemeal affect to blocks.\n\nThe latter is meant to enable growing of _Banana Fonds_ from [Neapolitan][NEAPOLITAN] without being dependent on the weather, but it could possibly have other effects on other mods too.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/sprinkler.png)\n\n### Overweight Farming\n\nIf present, some compatibility features for [Overweight Farming][OVERWEIGHT_FARMING] is added.  \nThis includes waxing recipes using the deployer,\nas well as showing the axe-stripping of overweight crops in JEI.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/strip.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/wax.png)\n","published":"2022-08-14T17:09:40.957018Z","updated":"2024-04-18T09:00:21.287135Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":552735,"followers":344,"categories":["food","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["UJTc0pk2","1wP6CNfI","Nk2dO6Go","KriL1JFW","r4yDHtFN","tA385l8n","JH33REuT","tZZRCOac","lXNFlrvW","OIhe0uO4","ZmhTpjLR","pRwBOCJc","gCGCFJis","hPDyRNw3","lrslRK8c","fGG0Gjcv","mG1fIOia","akAH2F1g","89gCgL8n","FF8UA0pu","LfIs9gRN","PmCarZvQ","BZLiJ13y","O8bSqUaV","sGqyWl93","U9GIWHMX","uv6f7FCw","t8iOd0XR","7HTroPJk","kvrLbSxC","1aTrUinS","qWFV16cD","3wyhfJQQ","vd7c2RPJ","mTr2nUPj","t3lFXxzY","aRK21L9m","qaNqtys9","nkNOsYBR","rYnuEPwn","tAgVGTaW","s9l4uqVE","IlpHtI0z","ZEitGVtL","73nfCddX","etRuKHcg","yZ9zZESN","giM4WleV","ZgvbijiO","tz8HfyEB","BWLxCZmk","W15dmG2v","fIWeey09"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GmjmRQ0A/9af7f38727e4c1dc30c67fefd80b15000a2b8c07.png"},"version":{"id":"giM4WleV","project_id":"GmjmRQ0A","author_id":"qxswSLtS","featured":false,"name":"Forge

Interaction is click-based similar to Jabba. Clicking on one of drawers on front will interact with that drawer.\n\n* Right-Click: Insert full stack in hand into drawer (or partial stack if the drawer fills).\n* Double-Right-Click: Insert all compatible stacks in inventory into drawer (or until drawer fills).\n* Left-Click: Remove a single item from the drawer.\n* Shift+Left-Click: Remove a full stack from the drawer.\n* Shift+Right-Click with empty hand: Open a UI to see exact item counts and manage applied upgrades.\n\nThe shift-click behavior is reversed from Jabba. This is based on the theory that you normally interact with stacks in Jabba, but will want to normally interact with single items in Storage Drawers. The controls can be reversed in the mod config to match Jabba.","published":"2024-03-02T20:21:13.894811Z","updated":"2024-03-06T04:17:23.769095Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":29091,"followers":33,"categories":["storage"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.8.9","1.9.4","1.10","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["HxmL9PcX","jBDpKNQU","FAzvjZqP","2mnDY1lv","KHeT8f2m","SyIcJHJD","xLf7BhhH","ACS10DVh","4Gl4Ciq0","OFLFaoSI","n9D7LOsG","WJsQWqRL","qvYg0XZY","JrW72m02","x8IjhUYB","zpJRdLGW"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/guitPqEi/58b4229c52876eff66c9f98a5d2a1e9b9f648501.png"},"version":{"id":"HxmL9PcX","project_id":"guitPqEi","author_id":"CjGInQcu","featured":true,"name":"Storage Drawers 1.20.1-12.0.3","version_number":"12.0.3","changelog":"Latest 1.20.x release, bringing to Modrinth","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-02T20:35:09.284114Z","downloads":19039,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ea5d343239fddf815ad44bee5a2d0dc2503f9cfb","sha512":"294f171c77478a91f009b83fb8f93ebf21ced13d6df2589e5ee45bb86aebb1fd137198feb91c00dbba28309fe4832398bfe4b51870310a8e5f701c99a603af6b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/guitPqEi/versions/HxmL9PcX/storagedrawers-1.20.1-12.0.3.jar","filename":"storagedrawers-1.20.1-12.0.3.jar","primary":true,"size":583143,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"l2DUk76U","user":{"id":"CjGInQcu","username":"Texelsaur","name":"jaquadro@gmail.com","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/CjGInQcu/12f007de1ea1dd12c6a768a6462b72706ff25807.png","bio":null,"created":"2024-03-02T20:16:08.481830Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"storagedrawers-1.20.1-12.0.3.jar"},"mods\\BadMobs-1.20.1-19.0.2.jar":{"sha512":"06f098b91d8799ed27aea7336a798250724ccdfb8f35ff95554c209ecbe2e8e73223c8930b3f697ce1bc465e71dadd1ade6a1731002e0b6fa9aac77a7768347a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"BadMobs","description":"Allows mob spawning to be disabled.\n","authors":["Darkhax"],"version":"19.0.2","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"BadMobs-1.20.1-19.0.2.jar"},"mods\\comforts-forge-6.3.5+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"c3b58a99f618ae7d2903e754f7d229263bcc23f15d21df355575b4c198dcca8d6e3fc414a02343ce658b0203f67ed862a0876164eb587cc0b70490a89968beb2","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"SaCpeal4","slug":"comforts","project_type":"mod","team":"k4xx1DQB","title":"Comforts","description":"Adds sleeping bags and hammocks for, respectively, portability and turning day to night, without setting new spawns.

The difference is\nthat sleeping bags can be stacked and are more convenient to use on adventures and hammocks are like\nan inverse bed, turning day to night.\n\n## Features\n\n### Sleeping Bag\nThe recipe for the sleeping bag is simply three pieces of matching color wool in a straight line.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/LCNV0HS/sleepingbagrecipe.gif)\n\nYou can also dye a regular White Sleeping Bag into any of the other colors!\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/R24frvM/sleepingbagrecipe2.gif)\n\n### Hammock\nThe recipe for the hammock cloth is simply a piece of colored wool in the center, sticks to the top\nand bottom, and the rest of the slots are strings.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/nQZH5Ld/hammockrecipe.gif)\n\nYou can also dye a regular White Hammock Cloth into any of the other colors!\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Jd5JcWf/hammockrecipe2.gif)\n\n**Please refer to [this](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Comforts/wiki/Hammocks#building) guide for\ninstructions on how to build the hammock.**\n\n**Configuration Options**\n\n- Auto-Use Sleeping Bag\n- Well-Rested Mechanic\n- Sleepiness Factor\n- Hammocks at Night\n- Sleeping Bag Break Chance\n- Sleeping Bag Debuffs\n- Insulated Sleeping Bags\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)","published":"2023-02-03T00:12:22.007446Z","updated":"2024-05-13T11:46:06.619689Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":813249,"followers":630,"categories":["adventure","decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["dHrSKL4J","c1r3IQ5i","aGuoSKwG","ArfJfNNQ","hQP0wrCY","ZyTxtFj8","IOKMgz2A","s5LKEIOP","67l2afHb","Ct4mFCUB","3QAM0nJh","de4Ew1fk","ywEwzvxB","U7z1UGEs","2TuGHiZI","DFNEJtPk","BZLqo5mz","CeY7jdWr","ctG2XnT3","NtVX4qbd","UdZSGyFh","xb4TiGPS","paJzntZf","1XmpwUAS","eny6SErU","ErWeNcks","ODTvTTsy","2R48PHme","tSzzMaGY","mRqCYEl9","9nh6jEqR","j7LyiMPf","GBZRiZpX","opkwrwqb","931lwegu","HdRgbiAf","35QTsWN6","FRk7TuF3","MFDqF6YP","ePAcflcJ","XIeDGnhd","Ef7a2lsY","TJTAQTxQ","FYC20xkF","XARWuNYu","3nNu4JfG","45xmlJpV","4gN165vy","Np0ASroj","Fsk1gLtM","jNc4BcHk","4xI610Ck","kFg7vTI1","RDL041db","EitEWOXA","hIVk1aXV","D2F8i5te","KgzjTw3n","Ga1xieMT","dgUU0OQZ","N8auIkK2","eERpuRc2","b447UIZg","7xyPjpyG","9sRsDjzm","1FZ3WFZm","DdseSSi9","OzDgRdin","rJbqJOyx","9qOe1XXv","eXcBRSHm","PjwVQUB4","IuKA4kB7","3krX2BL3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/SaCpeal4/ed4840f0c9a30e04ad88413bd82cd762dd6ec95d.png"},"version":{"id":"KgzjTw3n","project_id":"SaCpeal4","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"comforts-forge-6.3.5+1.20.1","version_number":"6.3.5+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

It seeks to give a more realistic feel to parts of the game that can benefit from it, like simulating physics and making model parts move that normally don't.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8ZhXRQ4.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wiggly Ghast Tentacles</strong> divides ghast tentacles into parts and makes them wiggle realistically, like those tentacle monsters you always see at the movies. Makes them a little more scary, but ultimately nicer to look at.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Squiggly Squid Tentacles</strong> gives a jellyfish-like effect to the swimming animation of squids. Also makes their tentacles flow more while moving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Playful Doggy</strong> changes wolf tails to be fluffier and flowier, wagging realistically while they stand and run. Also makes tamed wolves lie down instead of sitting. Hold up some meat and they'll roll over, too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Flowy Ocelot Tail</strong> takes away the stick tails of the current ocelots and gives them something nicer instead. Fully animated flowing tails that move while they stand or run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Curly Cat Tail</strong> brings those beautiful animated flowing tails ocelots are so proud to have to cats as well. And that's not all; they even curl around their bodies when they sit!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Oinky Pig</strong> adds a very subtle animation, makes a pig's snout move when it oinks. It only moves up and down ever so slightly, but it's there. Just a little bit more life for your livestock. And don't you forget about the floaty ears! Pretty big for such a small animal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wobbly Cow Udder</strong> makes the udders on cows wobble around when they walk. Also makes their udders have nipples, but if you're sensitive to that kind of thing those can be deactivated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bucka Bucka Chicken</strong> makes chicken's bills open and close when they cluck. The bill is also a lot more slim, so no more confusing chickens with ducks! And when they strut their heads move back and forth, the wattles under the bill swing around and their wings flap a little. Just like the real deal!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wiggly Villager Nose</strong> does a subtle change, this makes villagers wiggle their big noses whenever they make their unique \"hmmm\" sound! It's a small change, but who doesn't get a kick out of it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wiggly Iron Golem Nose</strong> is exactly the same as above, except for iron golems! Since they don't make any noise the nose wiggles around when they're hurt instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Jiggly Liquidy Slime</strong> brings a pleasing visual change: This makes the insides of slimes flow around like liquid. They splish-splosh about even more when they jump. The eyes, the mouth, and the core itself all move independently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Magma Cube Burger</strong> adds a custom death animation to magma cubes, which causes their bodies to form into a pile of steamy, delicious hamburger patties when they die. Unfortunately, you can't eat them because they're way too hot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Spider Knees</strong> are a truly stunning visual addition. Spiders now finally have the knees they've always dreamed of. Also affects cave spiders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wobbly Creeper</strong> wakes some memories of that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2rDbRUDkds\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">very popular music video</span></a> from way back in the day by the one and only <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshoKvlZGZ20rVgazZp5vnQ\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">CaptainSparklez</span></a>. Remember the really cute wobbly Creeper? Well, it's in the game now. The full thing, the real deal, exactly like the video. Probably the best custom animation in the entire collection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Arm Flailing Enderman</strong> makes an angry enderman wave its arms around wildly while chasing its target. Suits their twisted nature very well: wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube endermen!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Animated Snow Man Stick</strong> makes a snowman's arm swing when it throws a snowball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Kneeling Sheep</strong> is pretty kneat. It makes sheep actually bend down to eat grass. It's no longer just their head lowering, their whole body lowers down to get a sweet sample of that succulent cellulose. Did you notice their KNEES bend, too when they kneel?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Familiar Horse</strong> makes horses more lively again, just like they used to be in older versions. Does this by adding back their mouth and knees while staying true to the vanilla model style.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Spitful Llama</strong> makes llamas open their mouth when spitting. How have they been doing that before?!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bending Humanoid Knees</strong> makes the knees of zombie-like as well as piglin-like mobs bend when they walk around. Looks pretty fluid and nice. You'll like it, trust me.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8ZhXRQ4.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server.

grow in, brand new **tools and weapons** to hunt and gather with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!\n\nIt's time to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the Advancements!** They explain many of the basic concepts, and are a good place to start from.\n\nPick up any item, then press the **L** key (by default) to open the Advancements screen. Or if you prefer a more direct guide, [click here!](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight is currently being updated for 1.18.2 and 1.19+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No, this mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\n**Please do NOT ask for backports!**\n\n**Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?**\n\nA. Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)","published":"2022-08-07T23:18:53.898484Z","updated":"2024-01-22T02:29:38.409339Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":624726,"followers":769,"categories":["decoration","equipment","food"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["kwef5VB1","jc4l8jNt","jhP9p06T","huqohPcW","yE9Uj2ud","vKnBI3zc","uRQmgrHj","N1aLfuNT","p5bkNiw0","9N99D1CJ","tKCwnbTN","umpztmTl","k7RoRFPF","rFTKVUtq","AxgOboGq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/R2OftAxM/8e7aa38ab94d94bb0a2894a218b69beb49002b34.png"},"version":{"id":"AxgOboGq","project_id":"R2OftAxM","author_id":"btHGOarG","featured":true,"name":"Farmer's Delight 1.2.4 - 1.20.1","version_number":"1.20.1-1.2.4","changelog":"## 1.2.4\n\n### Updates\n- The Cooking Pot item now displays more information than before:\n  - A blue bar will be shown to indicate the amount of meal servings stored, similar to how Bundles display their fullness;\n  - The tooltip will display the stored food's item sprite alongside its name;\n- When viewing basic crops in JEI, they will display info on where they can be found as Wild Crops.\n\n### Fixes\n- (1.20) Creative Tab registration has been moved to server-side, so that other mods can access them for game logic;\n- Structure files for compost heaps are now format-updated with datagen, thus avoiding excessive DFU triggers on world gen.

The menu also lets you toggle the visibility of disabled waypoints, toggle rendering all sets and change the current waypoint set.

In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, it isn't as simple. However, if you can download the server world save and enter the world in singleplayer, then you can pregenerate the world using a method of your choice, relog and then use the \"Convert All Regions\" in the world map settings to convert the whole world save to a multiplayer-compatible map instance saved to <i>XaeroWorldMap->World->null->cm$converted</i>. You can copy/move that map instance folder to your server map instances in the XaeroWorldMap folder.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page. It should cover most cases. Contact me, if it doesn't help.</p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have the minimap installed, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p>(requires minimap to work)&nbsp;<strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart. Do the same for the minimap mod.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

The mechanical chisel also has a filter to specify a specific block in the recipe as output.\n\n<img alt=\"Mechanical chisel animation\" width=400 src=\"https://imgur.com/dIXNUdq.gif\">  \n<br><br>\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/ivVKNcv.gif)\n\n### FAQ\n**Can I use your mod in my modpack?**  \nYes, feel free to use my mod in your modpack\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/ivVKNcv.gif)\n\n### Discord\nFor future content, upcoming mods, and discussion, feel free to join the SuperMartijn642 discord server!  \n[<img width='400' src='https://imgur.com/IG1us6p.png'>](https://discord.gg/QEbGyUYB2e)\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/ivVKNcv.gif)\n\n### Legal Stuff\nRechiseled: Create is the property of SuperMartijn642 and is protected under copyright law and may not be altered or reuploaded without direct permission from SuperMartijn642.","published":"2023-07-16T21:23:25.117143Z","updated":"2024-04-23T23:57:49.588735Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":238370,"followers":102,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":["technology"],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["29ypMFFz","ObEtXrZk","9rjfhIDL","Y2RSSmOb","xwoaJCZo","ZWTqq1kk","V77R63CC","8cFZYr1L","ML50hG0W","IGOisYEo","8L8nGX6c","RIy7dLkv","FqaBV60D","ZRNgGu1R","nMerdgx4","LZKMAa6P","NXwBBB2n","MHHzYPWL","olCqZrAk","I2zO7N82","esHUHh8U","hIQUpGne","R9B3ktWE"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/E6867niZ/bdde59373bd2045a56cff2f10c1b120c8135a99f.png"},"version":{"id":"NXwBBB2n","project_id":"E6867niZ","author_id":"3KDmigFH","featured":false,"name":"Rechiseled: Create 1.0.2","version_number":"1.0.2-forge-mc1.20","changelog":"### Rechiseled: Create 1.0.2\n- Added Ukrainian translations (thanks to unroman!)\n\n### Rechiseled: Create 1.0.1\n- Fixed invalid resource paths warnings\n\n### Rechiseled: Create 1.0.0a\n- Fixed lighting not looking correct for blocks with connecting models\n\n### Rechiseled: Create 1.0.0\n- Initial release of Rechiseled: Create\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-09T15:31:17.802439Z","downloads":17446,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ce33c06e2d087470c3ddaf12ae0f676da7872699","sha512":"a4167d24e978484c8aa521cc63dcf8e2dc8df0f110564488782650611f94426cef4086f6e411849094dd16db9eb53c85aa369745cac00ff55ba3654fae1fe7ca"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/E6867niZ/versions/NXwBBB2n/rechiseledcreate-1.0.2-forge-mc1.20.jar","filename":"rechiseledcreate-1.0.2-forge-mc1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":670453,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"B0g2vT6l","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"LNytGWDc","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"iX019gmR","user":{"id":"3KDmigFH","username":"SuperMartijn642","name":"Martijn van den Brand","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12382965?v=4","bio":"I am a Java programmer, I study computer science and I make a bunch of mods for the game Minecraft.","created":"2022-06-05T11:36:30.012514Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"rechiseledcreate-1.0.2-forge-mc1.20.jar"},"mods\\citadel-2.5.4-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"98f3610b2ee6782211369b7beedb57392d41db3bf0f0ce143fe349ab783766429bb3049f0dbe5ee7998430f19d53e674348caf0cafd6c84a7d379ec6cea17ad4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"jJfV67b1","slug":"citadel","project_type":"mod","team":"rByA3asR","title":"Citadel","description":"A Lightweight Library","body":"![Citadel-Logo](https://i.imgur.com/KyeiwRx.png)\n\"My analysis of historical data suggests an 97.34% probability that you are aware of my birth on your planet, and my rebirth into beauty on Citadel Station.\" -System Shock 2\n\n \n\nCitadel is a Library mod required for advanced animations and entity properties in 1.14 and beyond. Citadel, being a Library, does not add many features by itself, but rather provides a frame work for other mods when it comes to animating entities, loading .tbl Tabula and .obj Waveront models, and for keeping track of entity properties. Citadel's predecessor, LLibrary, will no longer be updated from 1.12.2, and from now on all of my mods will use Citadel. Citadel's code base is largely derived from LLibrary, and the code is used with permission from Gegy1000, the maintainer of LLibrary and its author in recent versions.\n\n \n\nIn versions 1.6.3 and above, there is also a config option for changing the cap on how many mobs spawn on chunk generation. This is useful when used with the many mob mods that require Citadel, as without changing this they can make it quite difficult to find vanilla mobs.\n\n \n\nDevelopers who want to use Citadel can read [the guide on how to add it to their development environment](https://github.com/Alex-the-666/Citadel/wiki/Getting-Started).","published":"2023-11-03T16:25:45.246822Z","updated":"2024-02-28T19:40:53.632594Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":428760,"followers":104,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["AhrngqR9","l54hCYzm","jWcSsP5K","LOHm0ffg","ge8ra0kG","u3vg28FG","AEa5lIzx","l1j29UHl","1xvYIdqx","aOl88G8l","k2akMR9x","Xdw9cSFG","rmDI9Owy","H2MVcwUf","3OJWvUG9","ssXkoBKk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/dea486e5291c6f8ca8813a22e1fa32fa14a4a47f.png"},"version":{"id":"ssXkoBKk","project_id":"jJfV67b1","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Citadel 2.5.4","version_number":"2.5.4","changelog":"-Fixed slow chunk load times caused by SurfaceRules\n\n-Added example rainbow shader","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-28T19:40:54.447673Z","downloads":163011,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e7f209ae09cf818ecf98698482b82a1cbe0fe058","sha512":"98f3610b2ee6782211369b7beedb57392d41db3bf0f0ce143fe349ab783766429bb3049f0dbe5ee7998430f19d53e674348caf0cafd6c84a7d379ec6cea17ad4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/versions/ssXkoBKk/citadel-2.5.4-1.20.1.jar","filename":"citadel-2.5.4-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":3181461,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"rByA3asR","user":{"id":"iBpwljlP","username":"AlexModGuy","name":"AlexModGuy","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iBpwljlP/921ad78a793efff6d03b582fa3dc1f06bb237426.jpeg","bio":"aka Alex Mobiles, Alexander Caverns, Alexthe668\n\nhttps://github.com/AlexModGuy","created":"2023-11-03T16:23:16.718366Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"citadel-2.5.4-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\Controlling-forge-1.20.1-12.0.2.jar":{"sha512":"622aaf07a0f0f0fb7a96bd68fc52716b67e3e06547674207e7af4a26afebbfe5379b5553feef8b3258964ecd288844f0018be7848a5cb4b86de375a24470cac6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Controlling","description":"Adds the ability to search for keybinds using their name in the KeyBinding menu, this allows players to easily find a key binding in the menu.\n","authors":["Jaredlll08"],"version":"${file.jarVersion}","icon":"C:\\Users\\juanj\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\d0ae59393a10daa261905091329e56bf8a69c38a.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"Controlling-forge-1.20.1-12.0.2.jar"},"mods\\mcw-bridges-2.1.1-mc1.20.1forge.jar":{"sha512":"31440bec536b6c15bb24cdf7edd2905d5016798e3d65719ccfb37b2511daac6e3ee32341832d29ff70121822dad1e446aa91dff4917be1d23864e3ecfc4f5318","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Macaw's Bridges","description":"Connect the world with bridges!","authors":["Sketch Macaw & Peachy Macaw"],"version":"2.1.1","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"mcw-bridges-2.1.1-mc1.20.1forge.jar"},"mods\\oculus-mc1.20.1-1.6.15a.jar":{"sha512":"bf5d1dd0d113f497b97d49dc75ba83ecb91d436bfedb8f337cc6e69a78a05841ac3b31bef7c508cdf2d0e66f787c2e647e37ff99c7a491f786bf72d66028f6fe","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"GchcoXML","slug":"oculus","project_type":"mod","team":"zFcUWaYx","title":"Oculus","description":"Unofficial Fork of \"Iris\", made to work with FML","body":"Unofficial Fork of \"Iris\", made to work with FML\n\nFeatures\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Features</summary>\n\n- Performance.

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!

Gatecrafting recipe files have been renamed accordingly.\n* The \"morered:red_alloy_ingot_with_jumbo_furnace\" recipe has been renamed to \"morered:red_alloy_ingot_from_jumbo_smelting\"\n* The \"morered:red_alloy_ingot_without_jumbo_furnace\" recipe has been removed\n* Added a \"transform\" blockstate property to wire blocks and wire posts. This has eight values: `identity`, `rot_180_face_xz`, `rot_90_y_neg`, `rot_90_y_pos`, `invert_x`, `invert_z`, `swap_xz`, and `swap_neg_xz`. Blocks placed by players will normally have the 'identity' state, this state is only changed when the block is rotated/mirrored (e.g. by structure blocks).\n* Wire posts' remote connection positions are now stored as relative positions. If the block has an altered transform state, the saved positions will be normalized to the 'identity' transform (and un-normalized when loaded). Wire blocks' per-side power storage is similar transformed.\n\n## Other Changes\n* Jumbo Furnace is now bundled with More Red via forge jar-in-jar\n\n\n1.19.2-3.0.0.2\n * Reenable JEI support. Oops!\n\n1.19.2-3.0.0.1\n * Fix crash when placing unplaceable blocks near blockless wires. Fixes issue #31\n\n1.19.2-3.0.0.0\n * Ported to 1.19.2!\n * Bundled cable texture slightly less ugly (still ugly)\n * Temporarily removed Bag of Yurting compatibility with wires and cables; their data format will be refactored to be more structure-friendly in a later version\n \n\n1.16.5-2.1.1.0\n * Added Bitwise Diodes, Bitwise NOT Gates, Bitwise AND Gates, Bitwise OR Gates, Bitwise XOR Gates, and Bitwise XNOR Gates\n * Fixed a bug where bundled cables would load incorrectly, causing them to have incorrect internal data after being loaded until their internal state updated\n\n1.16.5-2.1.0.3\n * Added support for the Bag of Yurting mod; wires, cables, and wire/cable posts can now be correctly moved by Bags of Yurting\n\n1.16.5-2.1.0.2\n * Fixed a bug where logic plates didn't correctly cause block updates when conducting output signals through solid cubes\n * Fixed a potential multithreading crash when registering screens during modloading\n\n1.16.5-2.1.0.1\n * Red Alloy Wires can now connect to levers, buttons, and pressure plates\n * Fixed a bug where red alloy wires weren't causing block updates correctly for certain blocks (mostly pistons)\n\n1.16.5-2.1.0.0\n\tAdded red alloy wires, colored network cables, bundled cables, bundled cable posts, bundled cable relay plates, and the bundled cable spool\n\tAdded \"morered:redwire_posts\" and \"morered:bundled_cable_posts\" block tags; added relevant blocks to these tags\n\tAdded item tags for red alloy wires, network cables, colored network cables, bundled network cables, and all the wools\n\tAdded \"morered:set_wire_count\" loot function for use with wire blocks\n\tAdded \"morered:wireparts\" and \"morered:rotate_tints\" model loaders for use with wire block models\n\tStone Plates can now be mined faster with a pickaxe but require a pickaxe to mine (logic plates can still be broken instantly)\n\tRedwire Spools' recipe now uses Red Alloy Wires as crafting material instead of Red Alloy Ingots\n\tStopped redstone dust from forming connections to logic plates and redwire posts on sides where the block has no input or output\n\tFixed bug where redwire posts and redwire post relay plates weren't conducting power through solid blocks as intended\n\tFixed bug where the Hexidecrubrometer wasn't updating itself correctly after being placed when its placement changed the state of neighboring blocks\n\tFixed potential issues caused by positions being stored incorrectly\n\tFixed incorrect description of previewPlacementOpacity parameter in client config\n\n1.16.4-2.0.1.3\n\tAdded zh_cn translations by Zorc\n\n1.16.4-2.0.1.2\n\tUpgrade to 1.16.4 and Forge Build 35.1.0\n\n1.16.3-2.0.1.1\n\tFixed potential crashes and other problems that could occur when attempting to place some blocks in places where the block can't be placed\n\n1.16.3-2.0.1.0\n\tFixed a bug that significantly impacted server performance whenever players began tracking chunks\n\tFixed a bug that caused the data used for rendering redwire wires to linger in memory when logging out of one server and logging into another\n\tRed Alloy Ingots are now part of the \"forge:ingots/redstone_alloy\" item tag used by several other mods; More Red's recipes have changed to use this tag. The old \"forge:ingots/red_alloy\" tag remains, but should be considered deprecated in favor of the other tag\n\n1.16.3-2.0.0.0\n\tAdded Hexidecrubrometer\n\tRenamed Redwire Posts to Redwire Post Relay Plates\n\tAdded Redwire Posts (without plates) and Redwire Post Plates (without connections to neighbors)\n\tTrying to place a block where a redstone wire post wire is is now denied on the client in addition to the server (this will help prevent \"phantom blocks\" in high-latency situations)\n\tAdded a new ingredient type: \"morered:tag_stack\"\n\tMore Red recipes now use tag ingredients instead of specific items in more places:\n\tMore Red recipes that previously used redstone dust now use the forge:dusts/redstone tag\n\tMore Red recipes that previously used stone plates now use the forge:quarter_slabs/smooth_stone tag\n\tMore Red recipes that previously used smooth stone slabs now use the forge:slabs/smooth_stone tag\n\tMore Red recipes that previously used smooth stone blocks now use the forge:smooth_stone tag\n\tAdded stone plates to the forge:quarter_slabs/smooth_stone tag\n\tThe default datapack included with the mod adds smooth stone and smooth stone slabs to the respective tags mentioned above as well\n\n1.15.2-1.0.1.0\n\tAdded Redwire Posts, Redwire Spools, and Red Alloy Ingots\n\tAdded two-input AND and NAND gates from porl!

(Connected Textures)","description":"Fusion allows resource packs to use additional texture and model types such as connected textures!","body":"![Separator](https://imgur.com/gZDWWY6.png)\n\n# Fusion Connected Textures\n\nFusion is a library for both Forge and Fabric which adds additional texture and model types such as connected textures to be used in resource packs and other mods!\nIntegration with Fusion can be done optionally for a soft dependency.\n\n## 📖 Wiki\n### For resource packs:\nhttps://github.com/SuperMartijn642/Fusion/wiki#for-resource-packs\n### For mod developers:\nhttps://github.com/SuperMartijn642/Fusion/wiki#for-mod-developers\n\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/gZDWWY6.png)\n\n## 🖼️ Texture types\n\n### Connected texture\nConnected texture are textures with a special layout which allows them to connect to other blocks when combined with the connecting model type. Fusion offers two connected texture layouts, full and simple.\nHere is an example of the simple layout:\n\n<img width='500' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/p19vrgc2/images/d2ed5f2c3af0cd8d2d7acc6b0c19d8a2a23145d0.gif' alt='Simple connected texture example'>\n\n### Scrolling texture\nScrolling textures are a type of animated texture which scrolls over an image. The scrolling can occur from any corner to any other corner of the texture, even diagonal!\nHere is an example of a conveyor belt:\n\n<img width='300' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/p19vrgc2/images/3dcde0711f815f3d20c9abc9d27b7af758816665.gif' alt='Scrolling texture conveyor example'>\n\n \n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/gZDWWY6.png)\n\n## 🧊 Model types\n\n### Connected model\nConected models are models which will connect to other blocks when used in conjunction with the connected texture type. Connections can be specified for specific blocks and states.\nHere is an example of an oak tiles block which connects to itself and acacia tiles:\n\n<table>\n<tr><td>\n\n```json\n{\n   ...\n   \"type\": \"connecting\",\n   \"connections\": [\n      {\n         \"type\": \"is_same_block\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"type\": \"match_block\",\n         \"block\": \"acacia_tiles\"\n      }\n   ]\n   ...\n}\n```\n\n</td><td>\n<img width='500' src='https://imgur.com/AoSdjrP.gif' alt='Connected model example'>\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/gZDWWY6.png)\n\n## 📐 Block overlays\nUsing the features provided by the connecting model and connecting texture type, you can also achieve block overlays!  \n<img width='600' src='https://imgur.com/I6Whhhe.gif' alt='Sand overlayed on gravel'>\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/gZDWWY6.png)\n\n## FAQ\n### Can I use Fusion in my modpack?\nYes, you are allowed use Fusion in your modpack\n### Do I need to install Fusion on the server?\nNo, Fusion is only required on the client and does nothing when installed on a server\n### Why does Fusion not work with Sodium?\nSodium ignores the Fabric rendering api. To solve this install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium).\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/gZDWWY6.png)\n\n### Discord\nFor future content, upcoming mods, and discussion, feel free to join the

Tweaks","description":"Enhances inventory management by adding various functions to the mouse buttons. ","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-05-12T16:27:48.472824Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1720016,"followers":1756,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour","7JVXOe3K"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"stb5nE30","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20–1.20.1

container to make it look like the fluid in the container (1.19+).\n- Right click the block with Glowstone Dust to make it produce light.\n- Right click the block with a Framed Hammer to remove the camo.\n- Right click the block with an empty fluid container to remove a fluid camo (1.19+).\n\n### Special behaviors\n\n- Framed Prism, Inner Prism and Double Prism Corners automatically activate a texture offset depending on their position when placed. This fixes the issue of prism corners not fitting together properly when building a larger surface out of these blocks. If this behaviour is not desired, you can toggle the offset state by left clicking the block with the Framed Hammer.\n\n- The Framed Wrench (and any other item in the \"forge:tools/wrench\" tag) can be used to rotate the Framed Block. On most blocks, the rotation behaviour is dependent on the face that was clicked.\n\n- The Framed Screwdriver can be used to cycle through different states of the camo block.\n\n- The Framed Blueprint allows copying Framed Blocks including their camo and glowing state. The rotation of the Framed Block itself is not copied.\n\n- The Framed Collapsible Block can be modified to create arbitrary slopes by changing the height of the four corners of a single block face with the Framed Hammer. Left click the corner on the face you want to change to move the face inward and left click the corner while sneaking to move the face outward. This modification can only happen on a single face at once and only within the bounds of a full block. If the four corners are displaced in a way that they can't form a plane, the visual result might be unexpected. This is a result of the inner workings of OpenGL and not a bug in the mod! The direction of the line separating the two triangles can be toggled by left-clicking the block with a Framed Wrench\n\n- When activated in the server config, most blocks can be right-clicked with a Phantom Membrane (can be changed in the server config) to make them intangible, allowing you to move through them. To remove this, right click the block with a Framed Screwdriver while crouching.\n\n- The latch of the Framed Chest can be switched between three modes by left clicking the chest with a Framed Hammer:\n  - Default chest latch (default state)\n  - Camo-textured latch\n  - No latch\n\n- The Framed Key allows locking certain Framed Blocks in their current shape to suppress neighbor updates. This allows placing blocks in configurations that would not be possible with the desired neighbors (i.e. placing Framed Stairs in the corner shape without keeping the necessary neighbors to force that shape).\n\n- The Framed Pressure Plates (all variants) can be switched between waterloggable and non-waterloggable by left-clicking them with a Framed Hammer. Their default state is non-waterloggable to match vanilla behaviour.\n\n### Important notes\n\nMake sure to enable the `experimentalForgeLightPipelineEnabled` setting in the `forge-client.toml` config file to get proper lighting on all shapes.\n\n# Configuration\n\nFramedBlocks offers a few configuration options to tweak certain behaviour. Listed below are the main ones relevant to players\n\n<details>\n<summary>Common</summary>\n\n- `fireproofBlocks`: Makes Framed Blocks completely fireproof by disabling dynamic flammability (default: false)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Client</summary>\n\n- `showGhostBlocks`: Shows a half transparent placement aid when a Framed Block is held (default: true)\n- `fancyHitboxes`: Draw custom hitboxes on blocks like the slope instead of their actual stair step collision box (default: true)\n- `detailedCulling`: Hides faces between Framed Blocks if applicable even if the face doesn't fill the whole block face (default: true)\n- `conTexMode`: Configures to what degree connected textures are supported on framed blocks (default: `FULL_FACE`)\n  - `NONE`: Disables connected textures support\n  - `FULL_FACE`: Enables connected textures on full faces located at the outer bounds of the block volume\n  - `FULL_EDGE`: Enables connected textures as above and on edges spanning the full block width on non-full faces located at the outer bounds of the block volume\n  - `DETAILED`: Enables connected textures support as above and on most faces next to other framed blocks\n- `overlay` category: Configure to which degree overlays for certain special interactions are shown (default: `DETAILED`)\n  - `HIDDEN`: Hides the overlay\n  - `ICON`: Only shows the icon of the overlay next to the crosshair\n  - `DETAILED`: Shows the icon and a description\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Server</summary>\n\n- `allowBlockEntities`: Whether blocks with BlockEntities can be placed in Framed Blocks (default: false)\n  - Note: placing BlockEntities in Framed Blocks may in rare cases lead to crashes. To fix a crashing block, either disable this config setting or add the offending block to the blacklist tag, the camo(s) conflicting with either change will then be removed when the block is loaded\n- `enableIntangibleFeature`: Enables the intangibility feature. Disabling this also prevents moving through blocks that are already marked as intangible (default: false)\n- `intangibleMarkerItem`: The item to use for making Framed Blocks intangible. The value must be a valid item registry name (default: `minecraft:phantom_membrane`)\n- `oneWayWindowOwnable`: Whether changing the see-through face is limited to the player who placed the One-Way Window (default: true)\n- `consumeCamoItem`: Whether applying a camo consumes the item and removing it drops the item again (default: true\n\n</details>\n\n# Datapack Features\n\n- If a block cannot be placed in a Framed Block and you think that it should be, you can add the block to the `framedblocks:frameable` tag via a datapack. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/XFactHD/FramedBlocks/blob/1.16.x/src/generated/resources/data/framedblocks/tags/blocks/frameable.json).\n- If a block can be placed in a Framed Block and you think that it shouldn't be, you can add the block to the `framedblocks:blacklisted` tag via a datapack. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/XFactHD/FramedBlocks/blob/1.16.x/src/generated/resources/data/framedblocks/tags/blocks/blacklisted.json).\n- All blocks in the `framedblocks:camo_sustain_plant` tag allow plants placeable on them to be placed on the respective solid faces of a framed block holding this block as camo. See the [builtin tag](https://github.com/XFactHD/FramedBlocks/blob/1.19.x/src/generated/resources/data/framedblocks/tags/blocks/camo_sustain_plant.json) for the default values.\n\n# Known issues\n\n- Mitigations for crashes with OptiFine break the rendering of the Framed Chest lid.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes.

Mobs","description":"85+ New mobs with stylistic quality above the default game.","body":"![Alex's Mobs](https://i.imgur.com/Se0dRBJ.png)\n\nAlex's Mobs is a Forge mod that adds 89 new mobs to Minecraft. All of these mobs fall into either two categories: most of them are real world creatures, like Grizzly Bears, Roadrunners, Orcas, etc; but some of them are purely fictional, like the Endergade and Bone Serpent. All of these creatures fulfill a necessary purpose, and either have unique drops, mechanics or functions, as there are no purely aesthetic creatures. That said, they also help make some environments in the game feel more alive. The models, textures, animations and AI are all stylistically compatible with the vanilla game's latest additions.\n\n\nThe new mobs currently added are as follows (fantastical mobs in blue, real-world ones in black, boss mobs in red):\n<details>\n<summary>New Mobs...</summary>\n\n#### In Release 1.0.0:\n- Grizzly Bear\n- Roadrunner\n- Bone Serpent\n- Gazelle\n- Crocodile\n- Fly\n- Hummingbird\n- Orca\n- Sunbird\n- Gorilla\n- Crimson Mosquito\n- Rattlesnake\n- Endergrade\n- Hammerhead Shark\n- Lobster\n- Komodo Dragon\n- Capuchin Monkey\n- Cave Centipede\n#### In Release 1.1.0:\n- Warped Toad\n- Moose\n#### In Release 1.2.0:\n- Mimicube\n- Raccoon\n- Blobfish\n#### In Release 1.3.0:\n- Seal\n- Cockroach\n- Shoebill\n#### In Release 1.4.0:\n- Elephant\n- Soul Vulture\n#### In Release 1.5.0:\n- Snow Leopard\n- Spectre\n- Crow\n#### In Release 1.6.0:\n- Alligator Snapping Turtle\n- Mungus\n- Mantis Shrimp\n#### In Release 1.7.0 (Mighty Monsters Update):\n- Guster\n- Warped Mosco\n- Straddler\n- Stradpole\n#### In Release 1.8.0 (Down Under Update):\n- Emu\n- Platypus\n- Dropbear\n- Tasmanian Devil\n- Kangaroo\n#### In Release 1.9.0 (Big and Small Update):\n- Cachalot Whale\n- Leafcutter Ant\n- Enderiophage\n#### In Release 1.10.0 (Ferocious Predators Update)\n- Bald Eagle\n- Tiger\n- Tarantula Hawk\n#### In Release 1.11.0\n- Void Worm\n- Frilled Shark\n- Mimic Octopus\n#### In Release 1.12.0\n- Seagull\n#### In Release 1.13.0 (Bygone Beasts Update)\n- Froststalker\n- Tusklin\n- Laviathan\n- Cosmaw\n#### In Release 1.14.0 (Come to Brazil Update)\n- Toucan\n- Maned Wolf\n- Anaconda\n- Anteater\n#### In Release 1.15.0 (Caves and Cliffs Update):\n- Rocky Roller\n- Flutter\n- Gelada Monkey\n#### In Release 1.16.0 (Atmospheric Update):\n- Jerboa\n- Terrapin\n- Comb Jelly\n- Cosmic Cod\n#### In Release 1.17.0 (Fan Favorites Update):\n- Bunfungus\n- Bison\n- Giant Squid\n#### In Release 1.18.0 (Fishy Business Update):\n- Devil's Hole Pupfish\n- Catfish\n- Flying Fish\n- Skelewag\n#### In Release 1.19.0 (Wilder Update):\n- Rain Frog\n- Potoo\n- Mudskipper\n- Rhinoceros\n- Sugar Glider\n#### In Release 1.20.0 (Very Scary Update):\n - Farseer\n - Skreecher\n - Underminer\n - Murmur\n#### In Release 1.21.0 (Forest Friends Update):\n - Skunk\n - Banana Slug\n - Blue Jay\n#### In Release 1.22.0 (Freshwater Update):\n - Caiman\n - Triops\n\n</details>\n\nMany of these mobs have unique drops or items associated with them. Following the traditional vanilla rules, rare or endangered animals do not have drops that can be obtained only through death. Rather, most of them, like the Komodo Dragon and Hammerhead Shark, drop their items when performing a specific function. Many of these drops and items can be used to craft unique weapons, arrows, potions, and armors with special effects. In addition, most of the mobs added are not outright hostile, but can be provoked by distance or attacking, like vanilla polar bears and piglins are. However, most of the unique, fantastical mobs are hostile.\n\nWhen joining a world with Alex's Mobs for the first time, the player will be given the **Animal Dictionary**. This is a very basic guide and documentation of each creature added by the mod, and should provide insight into uses for each of the mobs or their drops.\n\n\n If lost somehow, this book can be recrafted with a vanilla book, a green dye and any item from the mod.\n\n![Animal Dictionary](https://i.imgur.com/TEtIfTB.png)\n![Animal Dictionary 2](https://i.imgur.com/tt0ew4K.png)\n\nAlex's Mobs is intended to be used alongside other mods, including those that add new blocks, mobs, biomes and dimensions. It is **extremely configurable**, and all mob spawns can be specified by BiomeDictionary, biome registry names, dimension tags, and biome categories. This mod should play nice with biome adding mods, and should be a perfect fit for many modpacks, whether they be Vanilla-themed or extremely advanced.\n\n\nSpecial Thanks to:\n\n- Nebula240 and StickZilla (Spanish Translations)\n- Mikeliro (PT-BR Translations)\n- ChirenCQR (Chinese Translations)\n- Robongio (Swedish Translations)\n- Elloellie (German Translations)\n- BardinTheDwarf (Russian Translations)\n- Othuntgithub (Korean Translations)\n\nThank you for translating our mod!

If that's not enough: you can upgrade your wand with additional cores, allowing you to place a block behind the\nblock you are facing, conjure blocks in mid air or destroy lots of blocks very fast.\n\n![](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/bV2crgLh/images/c9dc4b40da63d535f90020335804e089addb5896.png)\n\n**Note:** These are the instructions for ConstructionWand version 2.0+, which introduced some new features.\nIf you are still using version 1.x, refer to [those](https://github.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/tree/1.16.2-1.7)\ninstructions.\n\n## Wands\n\nThere are basic wands made from stone, iron and diamond and the Infinity wand. Wands from higher tiers are more powerful\nand last longer. These properties can be changed in the config.\n\n| Wand     | Durability  | Max. Blocks | Upgradeable | Angel distance | Max. Blocks (Destroy) |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| Stone    | 131         | 9           | No          | -              | -                     |\n| Iron     | 250         | 27          | Yes         | 1              | 9                     |\n| Diamond  | 1561        | 128         | Yes         | 4              | 25                    |\n| Infinity | Unbreakable | 1024        | Yes         | 8              | 81                    |\n\n## Crafting\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting1.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting2.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting3.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting4.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting5.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting6.png)\n\n## Keybindings\n\nTo change a wand's core and options or undo your placement you need to hold down the wand option key\n(refered as OPTKEY). By default, this is CTRL, but it can be changed in the client config file. To prevent unwanted\nchanges to your options, you can configure that you have to hold down SNEAK as well to change options or open up the\nGUI.\n\n## Wand cores\n\nWand cores are magical gemstones that make your wand do its thing.\n\nEvery wand comes with a Construction core. You can make your wand even better by putting\naditional cores into it. Put your new core together with your wand in a\ncrafting grid to install it. To switch between cores, hold down OPTKEY and left click empty space\nwith your wand.\nStone wands can't be upgraded.\n\n**Construction core**\n\nExtend your build on the side facing you. Maximum number of blocks depends on wand tier.\nHold down OPTKEY and scroll to change placement restriction\n(Horizontal, Vertical, North/South, East/West, No lock).\n\n**Angel core**\n\nPlace a block on the opposite side of the block (or row of blocks) you are facing. Maximum distance depends\non wand tier. Right click empty space to place a block in midair (similar to angel blocks, hence the name).\nTo do that, you'll need to have the block you want to place in your offhand. You can't place a block in midair\nif you've fallen more than 10 blocks deep (no easy rescue tool from falling into the void).\n\n**Destruction core**\n\nDestroy blocks (no tile entities) on the side facing you. Maximum number of blocks depends on wand tier.\nRestrictions work just like with the Construction core. Destroyed blocks disappear into the void,\nyou can use the undo feature if you've made a mistake.\n\n## Options\nSNEAK+OPTKEY+Right clicking empty space opens the option screen of your wand.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/options.png)\n\n**Restriction:** If restriction is enabled the wand will only place blocks in one row or column\n(choose between North/South, East/West on a horizontal plane and Horizontal, Vertical on a vertical plane).\nIf the direction lock is switched off, the wand will extend the entire face of the building it's pointed at. This option\nhas no effect if the angel core is enabled.\n\n**Direction:** If set to \"Player\" the wand places blocks in the same direction as if they were placed by yourself.\nTarget mode places the blocks in the same direction as their supporting block. See the picture below:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/placedir.png)\n\n**Replacement:** Enables/disables the replacement of replaceable blocks (Fluids, snow, tallgrass).\n\n**Matching:** Select which blocks are extended by the wand. If set to \"EXACT\" it will only extend blocks that\nare exactly the same as the selected block.<br>\n\"SIMILAR\" will treat similar blocks equally (e.g. extend dirt and grass blocks).<br>\n\"ANY\" will extend any block on the face of the building you're looking at.\n\n**Random:** If random mode is enabled, the wand places random blocks from your hotbar.<br>\n~~Shamelessly stolen~~ Inspired by the Trowel from Quark.\n\n## Undo\n\nHolding down Sneak+OPTKEY while looking at a block will show you the last blocks you placed with a green border around\nthem. Sneak+OPTKEY+Right clicking any of them will undo the operation, giving you all the items back. If you used the\nDestruction core, it will restore the blocks.\n\n## Additional features\n\n- Shulker boxes, bundles (MC 1.17+) and many containers from other mods can provide building blocks for the wand\n\n- Botania compatibility: The Black Hole Talisman can supply blocks just like shulker boxes can.

You can play a tune with speakers, display text or images on a monitor, connect all your\ncomputers together with modems, and much more.\n\nComputers can now also interact with inventories such as chests, allowing you to build complex inventory and item\nmanagement systems.\n\n![A chest's contents being read by a computer and displayed on a monitor.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/peripherals.png)\n\n## Getting Started\nWhile ComputerCraft is lovely for both experienced programmers and for people who have never coded before, it can be a\nlittle daunting getting started. Thankfully, there's several fantastic tutorials out there:\n\n - [Direwolf20's ComputerCraft tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUHUhfCY5A \"ComputerCraft Tutorial Episode 1 - HELP! and Hello World\")\n - [Sethbling's ComputerCraft series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSsx4VSe-Uk \"Programming Tutorial with Minecraft Turtles -- Ep. 1: Intro to Turtles and If-Then-Else_End\")\n - [Lyqyd's Computer Basics 1](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/15033-computer-basics-i/ \"Computer Basics I\")\n\nOnce you're a little more familiar with the mod, the [wiki](https://tweaked.cc/) provides more detailed documentation on the\nvarious APIs and peripherals provided by the mod.\n\nIf you get stuck, do [ask a question on GitHub][GitHub Discussions] or pop in to the ComputerCraft's [IRC channel][IRC].\n\n## Get Involved\nCC: Tweaked lives on [GitHub].

It presents a tech-based, futuristic theme, centered around the concept of using energy and technology to convert matter into energy and vice versa. Please come visit our [homepage](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne).\n\n![image of subnetworks from the guidebook](https://guide-assets.appliedenergistics.org/minecraft-1.20.1/ae2/ae2-mechanics/subnetworks_scene1.njRxulYCJ84v.png)\n\nKey features of the mod include:\n\n**Storage Systems**: AE2 revolutionizes storage in Minecraft. The mod adds a network-based digital storage system, where items and blocks are stored as energy in a digital form within a network of connected devices. This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items.\n\n**Auto-Crafting**: Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort.\n\n**Networking and Channels**: AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system. Devices connected to the same network can communicate and interact with each other, and the channel system limits the number of devices that can be connected to a single cable, adding a layer of planning and organization to your builds.\n\n**Spatial Storage**: This feature allows players to store entire regions of space within a spatial storage cell. Essentially, you can take a chunk of the world, including all blocks, items, and entities within, and store it digitally to be released later.\n\n**Unique Resources**: AE2 introduces several new resources and materials for crafting its technological components, such as Certus Quartz, Fluix Crystals, and Inscribers. Many of these new materials come with their own decorative blocks to spice up your builds.\n\nAE2 is known for the complexity and depth it adds to Minecraft's tech gameplay, encouraging players to create, optimize, and manage large-scale, efficient systems. It is a fantastic mod for those who love to automate processes and manage resources efficiently.","published":"2021-12-14T11:50:43.324146Z","updated":"2024-05-28T21:17:23.133302Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":506844,"followers":529,"categories":["storage","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["OqkivEmV","DZZbZnbH","cLm6eoS7","Bf4qfsQf","6AN4WLgf","n6ctl28A","ePPHPjw7","EkIUZgzp","uWZo3axN","kOb7LSAK","pRtKJO4l","2TIYWbvo","aUAC5DXB","mlkfFOT9","Q6LSGEqw","f0cVzJbq","xKkeaqkM","2OY506tW","LmtoNQhm","Ieppgyii","XSv7aCzj","7rSpITeE","Z32dIodF","fMM2pwnM","Woty8glY","NFcpTG3k","W5IItIBw","xDGpy4Qn","ByV6cOMZ","nZG3f7mn","697yLiPU","fjroW9SS","BF8g0TZ3","sWmGENVC","qosXJAjq","OiY2lfg0","3FuIT2JI","5KhL4WhW","RWto5Lhw","wHN8x90L","sm5CvPw0","oMLKu1Ze","nuYdiTZB","oLeqpmhw","mV6fTxoi","kOcIph1U","HJrR1zgA","JSwFZQ02","aR5tGCcS","s3g4KtWI","enxs5scj","9WXP1AHX","mv6YbdV3","7Gq3qbtw","bD9ZXRfC","7UmbOb4g","WVYkyvRH","bpkm2yMw","C5nwXELu","ZaNpnMCh","OFBWYrp4","PvPdRUHX","PDkmB4UV","zkC0WSUn","Z6jnGDF9","5xa1OSzf","5EyIPVWA","XVFb5sJ7","WzDBx3u7","YNFx3Hjn","nrq8eC4Q","6VmOchNB","9XtLETKp","hCIvVRgg","RFmdcgz3","vrdekdmw","Z8OKgUoh","P4SHVMac","25KjhlGv","S3K8G49B","6qQEQmM8","36EMfB3q","DZd4yQe4","c3zEVaQ8","wYymrhE4","8HeKobcP","yz68xU3j","pcHc3tZs","MrXpPIvo","aszqg0Wn","WAh5HPC8","RgkwNSjT","62yssi1E","A5FUIGjh","q5TQ3zgd","9P35YnKN","ix3GcoBP","RJnK9Ovj","MoGLgJK1","t3aUE6HS","7NWAte1m","PWdOzVug","HQd68kb6","lp2vAcHP","c0KKkf1Z","zhr2jXaL","9evKVcVd","MPdVG6oo","COSdQAoF","TBVf9h2p","CKA0xF7f","GL3uhBGD","brl6VeNy","TMEAMYIx","g7uJnOOS","sALiGsl3","yIupDKor","oAGWsu3M","JRLfd73N","UAuf0uiD","3Mvq6QHo","L6VGYHd3","y5W8KGqT","xGjt6qMm","sOqmy2ww","COba8tGt","8C4WbuoI","NX3fAZif","DsTIvcA1","Tw8kyhfI","NHcKcc8c","Xc1WEGPd","1HKx8M9v","qf2Yz73T","8HEK7sk8","ijZQY1Rd","xzP4cydc","a5pC6xdL","QalOLGBM","RpMpf7zi","Zrp3c9yN","7vB6vk2v","7ACUdipn","Sz6f1zJd","qfpQmwll","lePuKDdy","TKhjxSIB","oS3Ga2mY","7j0MvcB1","IcREcVDb","Mdn0ka1O","AxEi5RIz","b13bPfeM","rLjoLUTF","wGIGpPsQ","tifFqBKk","W4efZESl","lThI0ayT","qBbqV301","l3tOwBzj","LxjXwNSj","Bj8oQseU","IWm9cQdw","CkK2zzkf","xUoHYNEg","5cb16tgY","HAKkYcmv","1kT0YXJf","BUHQD4RJ","lT1sdBmI","fwLnPXom","8edEAu2V","aQH6ftSR","U3MExcIx","OIOSSXhK","Cf5vGMwV","XfVOZDN8","jgICE67P","nhQTb3m4","ZVjAvWE5","MNGBfmiy","b1U0ez1e","fFh1IdTY","fugqOJWC","LznTi8p2","dhrGFcqh","VI3B0aKr","ibJ4Ydxw","ZBr63LNs","qGKR0YVC","d1AtkO1b","3ZI8DotD","YO5wVxT7","XCXfEG6G","hNV0u2Ke","GkAgfE4B","u5dC9pjL","ZZZyMiY4","NmC7F1OZ","i1h1wOhr","3fQeIJU2","Hnumk0Bl","RQKXi0Jk","ZyC52h3W","SK6yn8MM","w2R8hIML","WJVipmUL","pThfoWlc","D7bfN7hf","QV62CH9w","BZL7JFgj","uAI0bShS","kP2VZhqZ","4I61MxJa","pHuguX3Y","hYG5tbva","FNy8w4ic","UmQtYI0G","792UNplB","Euz9WnGy","JWh6WyXU","FzURHfti","RpmE1nzj","UvErlgaY","xn5sieSc","Lo9sz0BU","pUCfuoqf","EtNeQMla","OK01nNQM","WIIZmqs6","kywcQ25B","isHbiIeZ","pGnl32B8","tjB3sQ3W","NoFBkXQe","9Vscdpuz","CEmkqbKV","qpG9cRjY","fZYI0nmw","mfB8KDaB","L3u3Zbmr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XxWD5pD3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"fZYI0nmw","project_id":"XxWD5pD3","author_id":"3HAu37Rl","featured":true,"name":"AE2

src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QrJ2aSu.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📖 About:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Straw Statues</strong> adds one simple item, that when placed down looks just like a player model. And that's no coincidence! You can give the statue a name to make look like any Minecraft player. Then there are plenty of options, for equipping the statue with gear, making a custom pose, configuring a few options, and generally for just posing the statue as you wish. Time to breath some more life into your builds!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QrJ2aSu.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Placing a straw statue will immediately open the confugration menu. When shift + placing or using dispenser the menu will not open, and the statue will autmatically have a random pose applied. Switch to different screens using the tabs to the left. Quickly switch between those tabs by pressing the <code>Tab</code> key.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/43/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Rotations Screen</strong> allows you to freely move around head, cape, both arms and both legs. Rotation values are restricted to a certain range to prevent weird rotations. To unlock this restriction, simply click the lock icon to move sliders on the full range of 360 degrees. When moving the sliders with your cursor isn't precise enough, try clicking a slider first, then use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move it around with greater accuracy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The screen also offers buttons for reseting the current pose, for creating a random pose, and also two buttons for copying the current pose and pasting it elsewhere. You can only copy one pose at a time.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/46/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The next screen is the <strong>Poses Screen</strong>. Here you are offered a selection of bult-in poses to choose from. After selecting a pose you can also go back to the rotations screen to customize that pose. Built-in poses are the same as armor stand poses found on Bedrock Edition, so you might already be familir with them.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/50/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Style Screen</strong> gives access to some basic options, such as turning the statue into a child. You can also set a name, which will define the skin used by a straw statue. The <i>Sealed</i> option is only available to creative mode players.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/51/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Model Parts Screen</strong> allows control over the different model layers of the current player skin. The options will only have an effect when the skin contains such elements. This screen is pretty much the same as the <i>Skin Customization</i> screen in Minecraft.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/52/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Position Screen</strong> allows you to place the straw statue with great precision, you can also change the rotation. To be able to better see how you're rotating/moving the statue around, click the magnifying glass button to hide most screen elements and give you a clear view. When moving the statue around a lot it probably is a good idea to disable its gravity on the style screen.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/54/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Finally the <strong>Equipment Screen</strong> gives you access to the armor stands equipment slots via a menu. This screen only shows up when Armor Statues is installed both client- and server-side.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QrJ2aSu.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/31/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/34/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>A simple straw statue, time to dress up!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Put some equipment on your statue</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/37/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/41/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>And set a player skin!

Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

API","description":"A flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers.","body":"Curios is a flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers. The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs. However, developers can still provide their own GUIs for their mod-specific slots if they want. The default keybinding for the GUI is 'g'.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NNByxcQ/curiogui.png)\n\n## Documentation\n* [How to Use: Users](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users)\n* [How to Use: Developers](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Developers)\n* [Commands](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Commands)\n* [Frequently Used Slots](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Frequently-Used-Slots)\n* [Adding to Your Project](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios#adding-to-your-project)","published":"2023-02-03T01:35:59.131618Z","updated":"2024-05-27T20:53:51.372313Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":857020,"followers":310,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["ZOlETE5v","RcA3vNIJ","oxBwmsHU","BcHPbGLy","Hm7rMu2c","bE5ThdZW","kWbiHplj","L0vjJCcV","FgmAnDM9","tnz2VF5O","EOOHEkth","vMbFvqVI","T123DHPM","N0zclyEx","WhjxWZUb","9eeEgj08","FK7tyAY3","M9lGrwqm","5qPuCFYD","zkj9iD0D","46cAcdnU","tl7biScA","cpywqo8V","BenekUpa","jVW2AKPB","hTLLayrx","uvQEq1xO","hW3XKfcj","p4wqBrgO","h3K3CopK","SeLn387u","dlv1r8No","GbHsY4Wa","9yUPTnRR","q9hLiOWr","mZaeXk5V","CQtJcas9","Kw26k0tE","XdwwXlEI","HgHicKvP","l0t6GlWP","opCpnbhi","8zBiV8Xc","SdxNj4Fa","BKMikxx0","NI17MAnS","nEba8UUT","9fDBKv2o","wOH4YWOv","y3sKrQEo","RmUMdDtP","odCtDjUV","usPjZolF","VykFFfeC","69B5WqQH","H3lLmHqx","aKokCTY6","nSNsIPLm","sVuCrC2E","DtYuKcQY","3VUlU5Ga","rAPky5mo","iy9E6HF4","qlWryz6z","MjnZWw5h","fPjcw2f6","anCi5HAr","U8r7nIbi","9hjtlBBI","fAlF6Tqn","nxZSj82i","PeTgKttm","t01OqNOZ","LgpxZ1yG","1aZiIHQO","nRQ4FbAf","UfNitWgy","AQ384Hch","1C6lBZmu","L0Tw2xgL","7Wei6s2K","9ro67WYY","adn5hcLm","TOk3Lved","WHmuOhGH","kKPFv8aa","DmFR6XO3","nJQvdzJp","YGa5gGxr","6EgL0aP4","7UxKaIU0","nyvHHyUE","wlGMHF77","29pH8hdz","CP6RHJq7","BiiqnvUy","suXbeF6v","tF9CH5Oa","TeuWjj6h","78rIk4rg","Ao2ykrAI","d3pyf6MJ","moWmAnjY","PEjKT9iG"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vvuO3ImH/2a7323ca80849de0bcb50299e18acdf8bf394682.png"},"version":{"id":"L0Tw2xgL","project_id":"vvuO3ImH","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"curios-forge-5.7.2+1.20.1","version_number":"5.7.2+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\nPrior to version 5.2.0, this project used [Forge Recommended Versioning](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

of Create and do that pretty well, we thought the next natural expansion would be moving on from steampunk to dieselpunk. We believe that create could be later used not just as a single steampunk tech mod, but due to its modularity and polishedness it is a perfect base for other tech mods aiming to Create (get it) something new with it, essentially using it as a library.
